### Installation, setup & updating

Nextcloud requires some additional steps after installation/upgrade that are not part of the package update process. After installation/update, visiting your install's website will automatically trigger the internal Nextcloud updater which will take care of these steps. For more details, see this package's documentation files.

### Other versions

Nextcloud maintains multiple stable branches at the same time. To install those, check out the [modular nextcloud package](https://src.fedoraproject.org/modules/nextcloud).

### CentOS/RHEL

For CentOS/RHEL 8+, nextcloud is available through the [modular repository](https://src.fedoraproject.org/modules/nextcloud). Due to incompatible PHP versions, nextcloud is no longer available for CentOS/RHEL 7 or older.
